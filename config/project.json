And here’s why it is probably a good decision to buy a Chambers office whether it is for end-use or for investment.\n\nKohinoor Square is one of the tallest commercial towers in the country and is an iconic structure located at the centre of the city. Investments in iconic commercial properties appreciate faster and depreciate slower than the market.\n\nThe location is congestion-free and will give you easy access to trains, metros and airports.",
